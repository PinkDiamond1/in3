# API Reference WASM

## Installing

This client uses the in3-core sources compiled to wasm. The wasm is included into the js-file wich makes it easier to include the data.
This module has **no** dependencies! All it needs is included inta a wasm of about 300kB.

Installing incubed is as easy as installing any other module:

```
npm install --save in3-wasm
```

### WASM-support

In case you want to run incubed within a react native app, you might face issues because wasm is not supported there yet. In this case you can use [in3-asmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/in3-asmjs), which has the same API, but runs on pure javascript (a bit slower and bigger, but full support everywhere).
