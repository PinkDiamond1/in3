//! Low-level, unsafe Rust bindings for the [`IN3`][https://github.com/blockchainsllc/in3/] library.
//!
//!
//! We recommend against using this crate directly.
//! Instead, consider using [in3-rs](https://github.com/in3-rust/in3-rs), which provides a high-level, safe and "Rusty" interface.
//!
//! **Note**: documentation for functions/types was taken directly from
//! [in3 headers](https://github.com/blockchainsllc/in3/blob/master/c/include/in3.rs.h)
//!

// Suppress errors from IN3 names
