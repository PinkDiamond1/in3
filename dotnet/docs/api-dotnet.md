# API Reference Dotnet


Python bindings and library for in3. Go to our [readthedocs](https://in3.readthedocs.io/) page for more on usage.

This library is based on the [C version of Incubed](http://github.com/slockit/in3-c), which limits the compatibility for Cython, so please contribute by compiling it to your own platform and sending us a pull-request!


## Quickstart

### Install with nuget

```sh
dotnet add package Slockit.In3
```
